## Introduction
The notebook consists of different type of machine translation models from simple to advanced with good accuracy. These model are trained on small data to translate from English language to French, it can be expanded to train on more data or translate other languages.

This end-to-end machine translation pipeline delivered as final project for Udacity AI Nanodegree course.
